## Opportunities for postdoctoral scholar and graduate students

We are looking for self-motivated postdoctoral scholars and graduate students who are interested in studying fundamental optical physics and exploring interesting phenomena in micro/nano-scale photonic devices. We are interested in scholars and students with background in physics, applied physics, electrical engineering, biology and material science. Currently interests of our group are ultra-high-quality optical resonators and their applications for low-threshold lasing, bio/chem sensing, nonlinear optics and quantum information processing. Scholars and students are also encouraged to extend our ultra-high-quality microresonators in more areas.

## Opportunities for undergraduate students

We welcome undergraduate students who have passion in science and new technology in optics and photonics to join our group. Interesting projects in the areas of microfluidics, sensing, and nano/micro-fabrication are available for undergraduate students.

Communications should be sent to Professor Yun-Feng Xiao through: yfxiao[at]pku[dot]edu[dot]cn
