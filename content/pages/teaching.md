## Fall 2011-2014, Optics

The Optics focus on wave properties of light. Starting with Huygens' principle, the class will introduce interference, diffraction, Fourier transform, and polarization et. al. The class is trying to provide a deep and comprehensive understanding to the beginner of wave optics. Introducing frontier of optics is included in the class to give an impression how wave optics is applied in modern science. Experimental display on wave optics phenomena is part of the class.
